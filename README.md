# mvco_light_env

Estimate in situ light environment at MVCO at 4m depth using data from:
radiometer casts, CTD casts, and temperature differences between beam and node records

The scripts in this repo:

---Estimate attentuation coefficients (k's) from radiometer casts

---Understand relationship between temperature and density in available CTD casts. Use this relationship to relate temperature diffrences over time to denisty and stratification over time - how often is the water column well mixed? 

---Apply k-relationships to climatology of incident light for in-situ light levels
